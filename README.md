# 🔐 PyPassword Generator

A simple and secure password generator built with Python :)

This project uses Python's secrets module, which is designed for:
* Password generation
* Tokens
* Authentication
* Sensitive data

---

## ✨ Features

* Generate passwords with custom length
* Optional inclusion of:
  - Letters (uppercase & lowercase)
  - Numbers
  - Symbols
* Ensures character diversity
* Uses cryptographically secure randomness

---  

## 🚀 How It Works

The user selects:

✔ Password length  
✔ Whether to include letters  
✔ Whether to include numbers  
✔ Whether to include symbols  

The generator then:

✅ Builds a character pool  
✅ Guarantees at least one character from each selected type  
✅ Randomizes character order securely  
✅ Outputs the final password
